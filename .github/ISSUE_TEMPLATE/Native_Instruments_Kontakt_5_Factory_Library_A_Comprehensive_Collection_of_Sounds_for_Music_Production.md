The Kontakt 5 Factory Library is not only a collection of sounds, but also a source of inspiration and creativity. The library includes a number of scripted instruments that offer unique features and functions.

The Session Strings instrument is a realistic string ensemble that can be played with expressive articulations and phrases. The Choir instrument is a powerful vocal synthesizer that can generate harmonies and melodies from any input.
